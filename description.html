  <br><b>Japan, in the 16th century, faced one of the longest and bloodiest civil wars in history, called the Sengoku Era or Warring States period.
  <br>In this game (inspired by the Shogun/Samurai Swords board game) you control one of 17 historical clans struggling for the domination of Japan.
  <br>The map expands the ideas of the board game with: Cavalry, Ships, Objectives and Alliances.
  <br>Each clan starts with only his captial and claims more and more territories from his foe.
  <br>After a few rounds of easy expanding into passive minor Clan territories, the real fight for domination starts.
  <br>Each Clan fights for its own and most of them will be controlled by the AI to make it lively and every game unique.
  <br>The AI gets many useful boni (all optional) and is challenging for a single player match, too.
  <br>Defeat your rivals and claim the title of Shogun for your clan! There is much to be conquered!</b>
  <br>
  <br>Requires Triplea 1.6.1 or higher
